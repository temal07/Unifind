import mongoose from 'mongoose';

// TODO populate this list

// no mayank keep the model i think you should keep it

// have another controller js file and write your code in it 
// oh my bad you already created a one. put it into controllers dir

// ye lemem check that file 


// but we already have the model and the fields

// Here is what I'm thinking: First, use the code in geminiController.js
// and ask it to generate a list of unis including the fields we defined 

// yo the thing is i'm not sure if gemini will be able to create
// thousands of unis. 

// i finished the login im goung to test it
